# üõ∞Ô∏è GPS Satellite ‚Äì ComputerCraft

## üìñ Overview
This script turns a computer or a turtle equipped with a wireless modem into a GPS beacon for the ComputerCraft location system.  
It allows other devices (turtles, computers, drones, etc.) to obtain their precise coordinates in the Minecraft world.  

This satellite is part of a GPS network consisting of at least 3 beacons (ideally 4 for better accuracy and reliability).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Continuously broadcasts its exact position using ComputerCraft‚Äôs GPS protocol.

Uses a wireless modem to communicate with other devices.

Supports both standard modems and Ender Modems for multi-dimensional networks.

Compatible with PixelLink when used in a monitored network.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

> [!TIP]
> Ideally, the satellite should be placed at layer 255 to maximize range.

1. Build the following structure (7x7x4):

</p>

2. Attach the wireless modem on any side.  
3. Precisely note the coordinates (x, y, z) of your beacon.  
4. Download the satellite script: *startup.lua* available in this repository.  
5. Adjust the x, y, and z coordinates in *startup.lua* to match your computer‚Äôs position.  
6. Restart the computer.  
7. Repeat this process for the other 3 beacons.  

## üõ∞Ô∏è Number and Placement of Satellites
Minimum: 3 beacons per satellite for basic functionality.  

Recommended: 4 beacons per satellite, preferably placed at high altitude (> y=100) to maximize range.

Modem ranges:

- Wireless modem: 64 blocks (range increases with altitude, up to 384 blocks at level 256)  
- Ender modem: unlimited, inter-dimensional  

## üîç Using with a Turtle
Example to get GPS coordinates:
```
local x, y, z = gps.locate()
if x then
    print("Current position: ", x, y, z)
else
    print("GPS signal unavailable")
end
